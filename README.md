# 5GNRMatlabSim

This repo is meant to be a simuilator for the physical layer of 5G NR.

I am starting this by reusing some old LTE code. I'll slowly work on reporpose it to match the current Rel 15 plans from 3GPP including the new BWs and subcarrier spacings. At first, this will just be a waveform generator. I'll eventually try to create a resource mapper and different physcial channels to fill the resource blocks properly.
